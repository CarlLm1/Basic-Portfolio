            <p>Just kidding, I don't understand any Latin. MY name is Carl, and I'm from West Sacramento. Learning web
                development is pretty challenging, however I'm ready to accept any challenges that I face ahead of me

            <p>Education has the power to transform lives.

                For nearly 60 years, this statement has been at the heart of UC Davis Continuing and Professional
                Education's mission. We believe that professional education plays a vital role in building our economy,
                improving our community and enriching the lives of the students we serve.

                We are passionate about sharing the resources, expertise and knowledge of UC Davis with working
                professionals around the world. By most measures, we have been successful in this effort. Last year we
                had nearly 63,000 enrollments and our students came from all corners of the world, from Elk Grove to
                Azerbaijan.</p>
